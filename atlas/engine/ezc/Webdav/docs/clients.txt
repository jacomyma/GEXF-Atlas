=================
Supported clients
=================

The Webdav component is constantly tested against different WebDAV clients.
The following clients are included in the tests:

- Nautilus (GNOME)
- Konqueror (KDE)
- Cadaver (Unix/Linux shell)
- MS InternetExplorer 6 (Windows)
- MS InternetExplorer 7 (Windows)
- Litmus (Unix test suite for WebDAV servers)

=============
Client issues
=============

Some clients do not behave compliant to RFC 2518. While the WebDAV component
is designed to work around such issues, some client problems cannot be fixed.
This sections lists known bugs in WebDAV clients, which prevent some actions
to work correctly with the Webdav component.

Nautilus

Copying of folders
==================

It is not possible to copy folders on a WebDAV server using Nautilus based on
gvfs/0.2.5 (maybe earlier and later versions). Nautilus performs a GET and PUT
request on the server to achieve a copy, instead of using the COPY method. GET
on a collection results in an empty document to be downloaded and uploaded
again.

---------
Konqueror
---------

Version 3.5.9 (possibly earlier and later) does not perform uploads of new
file. The client first checks if the file to upload already exists on the
server, which results in a (usually expected) 404 error. Konquerors error
handling steps in here and avoids the upload.
