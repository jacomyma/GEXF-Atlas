            <title>Woodsongs 460: Pieta Brown and Antsy McClain</title>
            <description>PIETA BROWN returns to the WoodSongs stage with a new album Remember the Sun. The daughter of two preachers&apos; kids, Brown spent her childhood in Iowa and Alabama amidst a bohemian and musical family. In her bare-bones Iowa upbringing Pieta was exposed to traditional and rural folk music through her folk-singer father, Greg Brown.  The new album features some of his strongest writing to date. ANTSY McCLAIN and the TRAILER PARK TROUBADOURS are energetic musicians who play country, rock and roll and folk with a VERY twisted sense of humor. The band is fronted by Antsy McClain who sings about life from the vantage point of an American trailer park. Antsy will be performing a special solo set for the WoodSongs audience. Their new CD is called Trailercana.</description>

            <description>MAMADOU DIABATE is a master kora player from Mali, West Africa. His musical lineage goes back seven centuries to the time of Sunjata Keita, the conqueror of the Malian empire.

The brothers studied at the Julliard School of Music and Bloomingdale School of Music and have taken their mastered skill to startling heights including performances at the Apollo Theater, the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and the Ellen show just to name a few. Their new CD is called Struggle from the Subway to the Charts.</description>

            <description>THE CINCINNATI DANCING PIGS are Cincinnati&apos;s premier Jug Band. The band performs songs that are humorous, many rendered funny simply by being performed by a Jug Band, and others are done for no apparent reason other than the fact that someone in the band was able to remember all the words. These guys are a hoot!    KEITH SEWELL is multi-instrumentalist who has spent the past year on the road with the Dixie Chicks. Orginally from a small town in Texas, this talented musician has performed with James Taylor, Marty Stuart, Ricky Skaggs, Jerry Douglas, and Sam Bush. His songs have been recorded by Montgomery Gentry, Steve Wariner, Sonja Isaacs, BR549, the Dixie Chicks and others. Andy Leftwich, fiddlist for Ricky Skaggs&apos;s Kentucky Thunder, will be joining Keith on the show.</description>

            <title>Woodsongs 417: Alejandro Escovedo</title>
            <description>Alejandro Escovedo&apos;s first new album in six years is a triumph. That it comes after his near-fatal struggle with and recovery from the effects of Hepatitis C only underscores that fact. He was born in San Antonio, Texas, where his multicultural heritage is an underlying factor found within his music. His songs can range from full force rock&apos;n&apos;roll to the subtle delicacy heard from a string quartet, sometimes in the same song. WoodSongs is proud to welcome back this acclaimed singer/songwriter and his band for a one hour Special Event broadcast devoted entirely to Alejandro and his new CD, &quot;The Boxing Mirror.&quot;  Performed in Lexington Kentucky.</description>
