Design Description
==================
The component uses the register_shutdown_function() and set_execution_handler()
to allow the catching of fatal errors and uncatched exceptions. At the start of
the script you need to initialize the execution environment and when your
application is done executing you signal the component that you have a "clean
exit".  In case there was not a clean exit the shutdown handler will pick up
and call your defined callback handler to display the error message.

There is one classes in this component:

ezcFile
-------
Contains a static method that allows you to scan through a directory
recursively and include only the files that match the specified pattern. A
pattern consists of an array of regular expressions which all need to match
with the filename before it is returned in the array of scanned files.

Algorithms
==========

The ezcFile::findRecursive() method accepts a directory name and a set of
filters. The algorithm is recursive in the following way: ::


    method findRecursive ( directory, filters )

    foreach file in directory:
        if file is a directory:
            files_in_subdir = findRecursive( file, filters )
            files += files_in_subdir
        else:
            include = true
            foreach filters as filter:
                if !match filter on file:
                    include = false
                    break
            if include:
                files += file
    
    return files
