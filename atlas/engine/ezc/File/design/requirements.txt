Introduction
============

Description
-----------
Provides functionality related to file and filesystem that PHP doesn't cover,
or doesn't cover enough.

Requirements
============
The methods in the file component are all standalone methods and cover missing
functionality and higher level file/filesystem operations. In the first version
the component should include a static method to recursively scan through a
directory and pick out files matching a specific pattern specfied by one or
more regular expressions.
