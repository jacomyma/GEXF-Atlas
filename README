*** This document contains : I.Install and II.How does this CMS work

-------------------------------------
INSTALLING THE CMS
-------------------------------------


---
WHAT DOES THE ATLAS CONTAIN ?
---

ADMIN : This folder contains the files for administrating the site

DATA : This folder contains what you've uploaded and written, and the structure

ENGINE : Contains the conf files, the engine, and the EZ Components library (full)

JS : the javascripts

PUBLIC : the public website


---
INSTALL
---

1. Upload on a server
2. Edit the file "atlas/engine/__config.php" to put the right path (depends on where you uploaded)

That's all !

### Default login:password is :
### anonymous:anonymous


---
EDITING PASSWORDS
---

Edit the file "atlas/engine/passwords". Each line has this syntax : "login:password".


---
SECURITY
---

For a better security you may like to:
- Install and edit in your localhost
- Do not upload the 'admin' folder to your server
- Just commit the 'data' folder to apply changes


---
UPLOADING FILES
---

It might be necessary to configure your sever so that you can upload large files.
Anyway, it's always possible to upload manually a document. The admin lets you make the bindings with any URL.
Just upload to "data/files" !



-------------------------------------
INSIDE THE ADMIN : HOW DOES IT WORK ?
-------------------------------------

The philosophy in 4 steps :

1) Create a section			Example : "The actors of Fairtrade on the web"
2) Upload needed documents	Example : a graph, a PDF paper, a spreadsheet...
3) Write needed texts		Example : What is this section about? Which methodology? Bibliography etc.
4) Assemble the structure	Example : The graph makes a map, the 'about' text is its explanation, this image is the legend...

---
Documents
---

A document is a name and a link to a file. You can either :

a. Upload your document and name it -> it goes in data/files
b. Put a link to any other document

These options make no difference for the system.

NB : you can edit a document bu change its link (ie. file). It will be replaced everywhere in the structure.


---
Texts
---

The texts are just texts !
Simplfied markups are allowed. See how to directly in the admin.


---
Structure
---

This is the big point.
You have three different types of pages you can create :

1. A map
2. An article
3. A resource

A map is typically a graph (GEXF). The main feature is to show the map in Flash.
But also if you want :
- The map as a PDF
- The legend (recommanded)
- A text for more explanations
- Option: show one map as the 'front' map. It will be shown as a highlight in the first page.

An article is typically a text.
But also if you want :
- Associated documents
- Option: show as the front article

A resource is typically a file.
But also if you want :
- An explanation text
- Show as front (option, several possible)

NOTE THAT YOU CAN SET A FILE OR A TEXT TO AS MANY SLOTS AS YOU WANT
For example, you may put the main PDF map as the PDF of the main map item, but also as a front resource.


---
KICK START
---

The system doesn't work if there is not at least a main map, with its GEXF, and a main article, with its text.

That's why the CMS is provided with several files and text that you can use to understand how it works.
Delete them when you're comfortable with the system!
